      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring Web Developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Brooklyn, NY</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        <ul>My hobbies include:
          <li>Binging on Anime and Action based series</li>
          <li>Tackling DIY projects</li>
          <li>Playing games on my PS4</li>
          <li>Trying out different restaurants in Atlanta</li>
          <li>Attempting my Youtube career</li> 
        </ul> </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to work remotely so that I may travel and work.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Atlanta, GA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As a person who's always questioned her calling, I struggled to realize what my passion may be. I consider myself sort of a jack of all trades because I'm always one to try something new, but never quite master it. Thinking back to when I was younger I could spend hours building my Myspace profile, repurposing templates to the point where I eventually would build my own page. I love to see my creative work come to life. What better way to grow and actually master something than by joining a Coding Bootcamp to become a Web Developer. </p>
